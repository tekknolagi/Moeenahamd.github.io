"As water given sugar sweetens, given salt grows salty,

we become our choices.

– from Rebus, by Jane Hirshfield

<br><br>

I’ve been on a poetry kick the last few days. It’s rhythms, its saturation, seep into the meaning of everything. I could become worse, I suppose, than reading poetry.

<br>
I discovered Hirshfield via <u>a blog on mathematics in poetry,</u> which I very much enjoyed. I then picked up Given Sugar, Given Salt, and everything in the collection (so far) has really resonated, Rebus included.
