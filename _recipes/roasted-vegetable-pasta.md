*Ingredients:*

Pick and choose which vegetables you like, in quantities you like. I like to go
heavy on the vegetables.

1. olive oil
1. salt
1. bell pepper
1. zucchini
1. broccoli
1. onion or shallot
1. red sauce, optionally made from scratch
1. garlic
1. pasta (rigatoni preferred, as usual)
1. (optional) vegetarian "meat" crumbles
1. (optional) basil leaves, for garnish
1. (optional) your favorite cheese, for garnish

*Steps:*

1. Put water in a pot turn the stove on.
1. Dice zucchini. Lightly salt and leave to drain in a colander.
1. Dice other vegetables.
1. Vegetable by vegetable, saute/sear each alone until you have some color. I
   put onions and peppers together, though. Add salt as they are sauteing.
1. In an empty pan, saute the garlic briefly (~30 seconds), before adding all
   the pre-sauteed vegetables.
1. Dump the pasta in the boiling water. Cook al dente (1-2 minutes less than
   package suggests).
1. Add red sauce.
1. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a couple of minutes. Add salt and pepper to
   taste. Sometimes I like to add a bit of paprika and cayenne.
1. When pasta is finished, dump out water. Dump sauce on top. Stir. Turn the
   burner off; the residual sauce heat will finish cooking the pasta.
1. Serve. If you have them, sprinkle some basil leaves on top.
