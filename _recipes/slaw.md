This goes really well in tacos.

*Quantity*: 2-4 people

*Ingredients:*

1. 1/2 can chipotle peppers in adobo
1. 1/2 cup mayonnaise
1. 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1. 1 tbsp cider vinegar or red wine vinegar
1. 1/2 to 1 small head red cabbage
1. several carrots
1. 1/2 to 1 red onion
1. 1 squeeze lime juice
1. 1 pinch sugar
1. salt (to taste)

*Directions:*

1. Chop the chipotle peppers in adobo
1. Shred or julienne carrots, onion, and cabbage
1. Mix all of the ingredients together; leave lime, sugar, and salt for last so
   they can be easily adjusted

*Notes:*

As with everything from my mom's kitchen, "I kinda just wing it." So adjust as
you see fit, just like she does.
