from [Yellow Bliss Road](https://www.yellowblissroad.com/authentic-mexican-rice/)

*Ingredients:*

1. 2 tbsp vegetable oil
1. 1 cup dry long-grain white rice
1. 4-8 oz canned tomato sauce
1. 2 cups water
1. 1 tsp chili powder
1. 2 tsp bouillon (I use "chicken")
1. 2 cloves garlic, chopped or minced

The original author makes this in a pot, but I can't be bothered, so I use my
rice cooker. Since it's the very simple kind (keep warm / cook with lid), I can
use it to saute.

*Directions:*

1. Lightly saute rice in oil
1. Add everything except water and bouillon
1. Stir 30s
1. Add water and bouillon
1. Cover rice cooker on cook mode and let it go
1. Let it sit/steam for 5-10 mins
1. Fluff with fork
