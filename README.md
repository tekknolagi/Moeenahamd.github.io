# My blog

Hello there. This is the source for my blog. It is a small website built with
Jekyll. You are welcome to fork it and re-use; it is MIT licensed. All I ask is
that you remove all references to me from it, including:

* My Google Analytics tag
* My GoatCounter tag
* My social links

Thanks.

## It's big though

But honestly, you probably should not fork it. You should copy it wholesale
into a new Git repository because the history contains some large assets.
